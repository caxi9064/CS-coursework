scarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea when 
about sunrise a great many whales and other monsters of 
the sea appeared among the former one was of a most 
monstrous size    this came towards us open 
mouthed raising the waves on all sides and beating the sea 
before him into a foam

 he visited this country also with a view of catching horse  
whales which had bones of very great value for their teeth 
of which he brought some to the king    the best 
whales were catched in his own country of which some were 
fortyeight some fifty yards long he said that he was one 
of six who had killed sixty in two days

 while the whale is floating at the stern of the ship they 
cut off his head and tow it with a boat as near the shore as it 
will come  but it will be aground in twelve or thirteen feet

 in their way they saw many whales sporting in the ocean 
and in wantonness fuzzing up the water through their pipes 
and vents which nature has placed on their shoulders

4 here they saw such huge troops of whales that they were 
forced to proceed with a great deal of caution for fear they 
should run their ship upon them

some say the whale cant open his mouth but that is a 
fable    

they frequently climb up the masts to see whether they 
can see a whale for the first discoverer has a ducat for his

i was told of a whale taken near shetland that had above 
a barrel of herrings in his belly    

one of our harpooneers told me that he caught once a 
whale in spitzbergen that was white all over

 several whales have come in upon this coast fife anno 
1652 one eighty feet in length of the whale bone kind came 
in which as i was informed besides a vast quantity of oil 
did afford 500 weight of baleen the jaws of it stand for a 
gate in the garden of pitferren

4 myself have agreed to try whether i can master and kill 
this spermaceti whale for i could never hear of any of that 
sort that was killed by any man such is his fierceness and 
swiftness

in those southern seas as i may say by a hundred to one  
than we have to the northward of us
